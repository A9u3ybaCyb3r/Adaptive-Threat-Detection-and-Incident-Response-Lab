# Preparation Phase

In the preparation phase, several key configurations are made:
- Snort Rules: Configured to detect potential threats, including:
  - Rule 1: Detects a reverse TCP connection on port 4444 to the Windows VM.
  - Rule 2: Monitors HTTP traffic on non-standard ports (8000 to 9000).
  - Rule 3: Checks for executable files in HTTP traffic looking for MZ headers.
  - Rule 4: Monitors standard HTTP traffic on port 80.
- Lima Charlie: Integrated with the Windows workstations and server VMs for advanced threat detection and response capabilities.
- YARA Rules: Rules are written to detect executable files in the downloads directory.
- Splunk Configuration: Alerts are set up for detecting reverse TCP connections.
- Forensic Tools: Tools like Kape, Registry Explorer, and FTK Imager are downloaded for forensic analysis.

# Create a Real-Time Alert for reverse TCP on Splunk
1. **Search for Critical Events**
- Use Splunk to search for Event ID 1102, which indicates the clearing of security logs:

  ```spl
  index=* sourcetype="WinEventLog:Security" EventCode=1102
	
- To verify the search logic, modify the query to test using a different event code, such as 4624 (logon events).
2. **Save Search as an Alert**
- Click **Save As** and select **Alert**.
- Configure alert settings:
	- **Name**: Security Event Log Cleared.
	- **Real-Time Alert**: Trigger per result as soon as the event is detected.
	- **Actions**: Add to **Triggered Alerts** and configure alert severity (e.g., medium).
	- Optionally, set up notifications via email, Slack, or other integrations.
3. **Simulate and Test the Alert**
- Clear the security log on the monitored Windows system to generate an Event ID 1102.
- Confirm the alert triggers and appears in the **Triggered Alerts** section of Splunk.
